# Abstract Strategy Games Designer

A comprehensive open-source framework and toolkit for designing innovative abstract strategy games for both tabletop and digital play.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project provides game designers with complete methodologies, tools, and resources to create abstract strategy games that offer deep strategic gameplay while maintaining elegant simplicity. Whether you're designing your first game or you're an experienced designer looking for systematic approaches, this framework guides you through every step from initial concept to final implementation.

## 📖 What's Inside

### Complete Design Framework
- **Creative Ideation**: 7 unique techniques for generating innovative game concepts
- **Design Methodologies**: Systematic approaches including core principles, design process phases, and common failure patterns to avoid
- **Game Mechanics Catalog**: Comprehensive collection of board topologies, piece systems, movement mechanics, and victory conditions
- **Evaluation & Testing**: 4-phase playtesting protocol with metrics for measuring strategic depth and balance

### Practical Resources
- **Notation Systems**: Complete framework for developing game notation for recording and sharing games
- **Implementation Guides**: Detailed guidance for both physical production and digital development
- **Curated Tools & Resources**: Carefully selected books, software tools, online communities, and academic resources
- **Game Concepts Repository**: Structure for documenting and tracking your original game designs

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🎮 What Makes a Great Abstract Strategy Game?

According to our framework, excellent abstract strategy games share these qualities:
- **Perfect Information**: All game state visible to all players
- **No Luck**: Completely deterministic gameplay
- **Deep Strategy**: High depth-to-complexity ratio (ideally 10:1 or higher)
- **Meaningful Decisions**: Every turn presents interesting choices
- **Natural Progression**: Games move toward conclusion without stalemates

*"The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do."* - Michael Porter

This principle applies perfectly to abstract strategy game design: elegance comes from constraint, and depth emerges from simplicity.
