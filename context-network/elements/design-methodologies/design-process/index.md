# Design Process

## Overview

A systematic approach to creating abstract strategy games from initial concept through final implementation. This process emphasizes iteration, testing, and refinement while maintaining design focus.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process Framework
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Process Phases

### Phase 1: Conceptualization
Defining the core game idea
- **Location:** [[conceptualization.md]]
- **Duration:** 1-2 weeks
- **Output:** Core concept document

### Phase 2: Prototyping
Creating playable versions
- **Location:** [[prototyping.md]]
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks
- **Output:** Testable prototype

### Phase 3: Iteration
Refining through testing
- **Location:** [[iteration.md]]
- **Duration:** 4-8 weeks
- **Output:** Polished game

### Phase 4: Finalization
Preparing for release
- **Location:** [[finalization.md]]
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks
- **Output:** Complete game

## The Complete Design Flow

### Pre-Design: Preparation
Before starting formal design:
1. **Study Existing Games**
   - Play broadly in genre
   - Analyze successes/failures
   - Identify gaps/opportunities

2. **Set Design Goals**
   - Target audience
   - Play time desired
   - Complexity level
   - Innovation areas

3. **Gather Resources**
   - Prototyping materials
   - Testing partners
   - Reference materials

### Phase 1: Conceptualization (Divergent)

#### Week 1: Idea Generation
- Apply creative ideation techniques
- Generate 50+ raw concepts
- No filtering or judgment
- Document everything

#### Week 2: Concept Development
- Select 5-10 promising ideas
- Develop core mechanics
- Write 1-page summaries
- Initial paper sketches

**Key Questions**:
- What makes this game unique?
- What's the core tension?
- Why would someone replay?
- How does it create depth?

**Deliverables**:
- Concept document
- Basic rule outline
- Initial component list
- Rough prototype plan

### Phase 2: Prototyping (Convergent)

#### Weeks 3-4: Minimal Prototype
- Create simplest playable version
- Focus on core mechanic only
- Use generic components
- Test solo repeatedly

#### Weeks 5-6: Enhanced Prototype
- Add necessary complexity
- Create proper components
- Write clear rules
- Begin external testing

**Prototyping Principles**:
- Start ugly but functional
- Test one thing at a time
- Fail fast and cheap
- Document all versions

**Common Mistakes**:
- Over-polishing early
- Adding features too soon
- Ignoring fundamental flaws
- Not testing enough

### Phase 3: Iteration (Cyclical)

#### The Iteration Loop
1. **Test** (2-3 sessions)
   - Observe gameplay
   - Note problems
   - Track metrics

2. **Analyze** (1 day)
   - Review feedback
   - Identify patterns
   - Prioritize issues

3. **Modify** (2-3 days)
   - Make one change
   - Update rules
   - Adjust components

4. **Repeat** (4-8 cycles)
   - Until metrics satisfied
   - Or diminishing returns

#### Iteration Guidelines
**Major Changes** (Early iterations):
- Core mechanic adjustments
- Victory condition changes
- Board topology shifts
- Fundamental rule rewrites

**Minor Tweaks** (Later iterations):
- Numerical balancing
- Edge case handling
- Component optimization
- Clarity improvements

**Red Flags**:
- Same problems recurring
- Complexity increasing
- Fun decreasing
- Testing enthusiasm waning

### Phase 4: Finalization (Polish)

#### Week 11-12: Rule Finalization
- Complete rulebook writing
- Create examples/diagrams
- Develop teaching script
- Finalize component specs

#### Week 13-14: Production Prep
- Design final graphics
- Create print files
- Develop notation system
- Plan implementation

**Final Checklist**:
- [ ] Rules complete and clear
- [ ] Components specified exactly
- [ ] Extensive playtesting done
- [ ] Balance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Teaching method developed
- [ ] Notation system created
- [ ] Implementation planned
- [ ] Community feedback positive
