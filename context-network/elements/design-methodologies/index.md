# Design Methodologies

## Overview

This category contains systematic approaches and frameworks for designing abstract strategy games. These methodologies provide structured processes for creating games with meaningful strategic depth while maintaining elegant simplicity.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Design Process
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Subcategories

### Core Principles
Fundamental design principles for abstract strategy games
- **Location:** [[core-principles/index.md]]
- **Contains:** Depth-to-complexity ratio, decision architecture, fairness principles

### Design Process
Step-by-step methodologies for game creation
- **Location:** [[design-process/index.md]]
- **Contains:** Ideation, prototyping, iteration, finalization phases

### Balance & Tuning
Methods for achieving game balance
- **Location:** [[balance-tuning/index.md]]
- **Contains:** Symmetry considerations, first-player advantage, dynamic balance

### Failure Patterns
Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- **Location:** [[failure-patterns/index.md]]
- **Contains:** Analysis paralysis, false choices, runaway leaders

## Key Concepts

### Essential Properties of Abstract Strategy Games
1. **Perfect Information**: All game state visible to all players
2. **Zero Luck**: No random elements during gameplay
3. **Abstract Theme**: Mechanics over narrative
4. **Finite State**: Bounded game space
5. **Clear Victory**: Unambiguous win conditions

### Design Quality Metrics
- **Depth-to-Complexity Ratio**: Strategic richness vs rule complexity
- **Decision Density**: Meaningful choices per turn
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules yielding complex gameplay
- **Learning Curve**: Accessibility vs mastery gap

## Quick Reference

### Design Checklist
- [ ] Does the game have perfect information?
- [ ] Are all outcomes deterministic?
- [ ] Is the ruleset minimal yet complete?
- [ ] Do players face meaningful decisions?
- [ ] Is there strategic depth beyond the obvious?
- [ ] Can games reach natural conclusions?
- [ ] Is the game balanced for all players?

### Common Mechanisms
- Territory control
- Connection/Network building
- Piece capture
- Pattern formation
- Resource management (deterministic)
- Area influence
- Blocking/Denial
