# Protocols

## Overview

This section defines formal protocols and specifications for abstract strategy game platforms, focusing on compatibility with existing systems (particularly AbstractPlay) while enabling extensibility and federation.

## Protocol Categories

### 1. [[game-interface-protocol.md|Game Interface Protocol]]
Formal specification for how games communicate with platforms, based on AbstractPlay patterns but extended for plugin architecture.

### 2. [[api-protocol-specification.md|API Protocol Specification]]
RESTful API definitions for game servers, enabling interoperability between different implementations.

### 3. [[rendering-protocol.md|Rendering Protocol]]
Standardized format for game state visualization, allowing multiple rendering engines.

### 4. [[plugin-architecture.md|Plugin Architecture]]
Extension mechanisms for external game hosting and dynamic loading.

### 5. [[federation-protocol.md|Federation Protocol]]
Specifications for multi-server game networks and cross-platform play.

## Design Principles

### Compatibility First
- Maintain backward compatibility with AbstractPlay where possible
- Provide migration paths for existing games
- Document breaking changes clearly

### Extensibility by Design
- All protocols support versioning
- Extension points clearly marked
- Plugin interfaces for custom implementations

### Vendor Neutrality
- No hard dependencies on specific cloud providers
- Abstract service interfaces
- Portable data formats
