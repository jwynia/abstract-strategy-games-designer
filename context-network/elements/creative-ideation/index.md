# Creative Ideation

## Overview

This category contains techniques, frameworks, and tools for generating innovative abstract strategy game concepts. It focuses on breaking conventional thinking patterns and discovering novel game mechanisms.

## Classification

## The Ideation Process

### Phase 1: Generation (Quantity)
- Goal: 50+ raw concepts
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Method: Apply generation techniques rapidly
- Mindset: No criticism, wild ideas welcome

### Phase 2: Expansion (Exploration)
- Goal: Develop 10-15 promising concepts
- Time: 1-2 hours
- Method: Add variations and twists
- Mindset: "What if?" thinking

### Phase 3: Combination (Synthesis)
- Goal: Create 5-8 hybrid concepts
- Time: 1 hour
- Method: Merge interesting elements
- Mindset: Look for unexpected synergies

### Phase 4: Filtering (Quality)
- Goal: Select 2-3 for prototyping
- Time: 30 minutes
- Method: Apply quick evaluation tests
- Mindset: Critical but open

## Quick Reference Tools

### Idea Triggers
- What if pieces could transform?
- What if the board changed during play?
- What if winning wasn't the goal?
- What if time was a game element?
- What if pieces had momentum?
- What if territory was 3D?
- What if connections were weighted?

### Constraint Challenges
- Design a game with only 3 rules
- Create strategy without a board
- Make a game where pieces never move
- Design with only one type of piece
- Create depth with 5-minute games

### Anti-Patterns to Invert
- Games that always end in draws → Force conclusion mechanics
- First player always wins → Dynamic advantage systems
- Analysis paralysis → Time pressure elements
- Runaway leader → Catch-up mechanisms

## Navigation

### For New Ideas
1. Start with [[generation-techniques/index.md]]
2. Use [[rapid-prototyping/index.md]] to test
3. Apply [[concept-filtering/index.md]] to evaluate

### For Refinement
1. Review existing concepts
2. Apply [[combination-methods/index.md]]
3. Return to [[generation-techniques/index.md]] for fresh perspective

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Generate quantity before quality
- Combine unrelated concepts
- Challenge every assumption
- Prototype quickly and roughly
- Keep all ideas documented

### Don'ts
- Judge ideas during generation
- Stick to familiar patterns
- Over-develop before testing
- Ignore "silly" ideas
- Work in isolation
