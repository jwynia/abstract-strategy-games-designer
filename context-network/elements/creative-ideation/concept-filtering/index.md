# Concept Filtering

## Overview

Quick evaluation methods for filtering raw game concepts during ideation. These filters help identify promising ideas worth developing into prototypes while efficiently discarding concepts with fundamental flaws.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Evaluation Methods
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## The Four-Filter System

### 1. The 30-Second Test
Can you explain the core game in 30 seconds?
- **Location:** [[thirty-second-test.md]]
- **Pass Criteria:** Clear, concise explanation possible
- **Fail Indicators:** Requires extensive backstory, multiple exceptions

### 2. The Originality Test  
Is this meaningfully different from existing games?
- **Location:** [[originality-test.md]]
- **Pass Criteria:** Novel mechanic or unique combination
- **Fail Indicators:** "It's like X but with Y"

### 3. The Decision Test
Are there interesting decisions to make?
- **Location:** [[decision-test.md]]
- **Pass Criteria:** Multiple viable choices per turn
- **Fail Indicators:** Obvious best moves, false choices

### 4. The Depth Potential Test
Could this support extended play?
- **Location:** [[depth-potential-test.md]]
- **Pass Criteria:** Emergent strategies visible
- **Fail Indicators:** Solved after few plays

## Quick Evaluation Tools

### Red Flag Checklist
Immediate disqualifiers:
- [ ] Requires luck elements
- [ ] Needs hidden information
- [ ] Depends on player elimination
- [ ] Has runaway leader problem
- [ ] Creates analysis paralysis
- [ ] Allows stalemates easily
- [ ] Requires extensive components
- [ ] Has unclear victory conditions

### Green Light Indicators
Promising signs:
- [ ] Simple rules, complex outcomes
- [ ] Natural tension/trade-offs
- [ ] Multiple paths to victory
- [ ] Scales well with skill
- [ ] Creates memorable moments
- [ ] Has "easy to learn, hard to master" quality
- [ ] Generates different game narratives
- [ ] Excites you to play it

### The Elevator Pitch Test
Template: "[Game name] is a [player count] player abstract strategy game where players [core action] to [victory condition]. The twist is [unique element]."

**Good Example:** "Quantum is a 2-player abstract strategy game where players place pieces that exist in multiple positions simultaneously until observed. The twist is that observations collapse not just one piece but entire quantum chains."

**Bad Example:** "Mega Strategy is a 2-4 player game where players manage resources, build armies, control territory, trade goods, and complete quests to earn victory points, but with a unique card system that... [continues for minutes]"

## Filtering Process

### Stage 1: Rapid Elimination (2 minutes per concept)
1. Apply red flag checklist
2. Check 30-second test
3. Binary decision: pursue or discard

### Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation (5 minutes per survivor)
1. Apply all four tests
2. Score each dimension (1-5)
3. Rank against other concepts
4. Select top 20-30%

### Stage 3: Development Potential (10 minutes per finalist)
1. Sketch basic rules
2. Identify core loop
3. List variants/expansions
4. Make prototype decision

## Scoring Rubric

### Clarity (30-Second Test)
- **5**: Child could understand
- **4**: Clear with one example
- **3**: Needs some explanation  
- **2**: Requires rule reading
- **1**: Confusing even with rules

### Innovation (Originality Test)
- **5**: Never seen before
- **4**: Fresh combination
- **3**: New twist on classic
- **2**: Minor variation
- **1**: Direct derivative

### Engagement (Decision Test)
- **5**: Every move matters
- **4**: Frequent hard choices
- **3**: Regular decisions
- **2**: Occasional choices
- **1**: Autopilot possible

### Longevity (Depth Test)
- **5**: Infinitely replayable
- **4**: Years of discovery
- **3**: Months of interest
- **2**: Weeks before solved
- **1**: Single session game

## Common Filtering Mistakes

### Being Too Harsh
- Discarding unusual ideas too quickly
- Demanding perfection in raw concepts
- Comparing to polished games

### Being Too Lenient  
- Falling in love with theme
- Ignoring fundamental flaws
- Assuming problems fixable

### Wrong Criteria
- Prioritizing complexity
- Valuing novelty over fun
- Focusing on components

## Post-Filtering Actions

### For Passed Concepts
1. Create one-page summary
2. Build paper prototype
3. Solo playtest basic flow
4. Schedule peer testing

### For Failed Concepts
1. Note why it failed
2. Extract good elements
3. Archive for reference
4. Consider combinations

### For Borderline Concepts
1. Identify fixable issues
2. Try one major change
3. Re-evaluate quickly
4. Make final decision
