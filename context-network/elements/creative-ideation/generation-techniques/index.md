# Generation Techniques

## Overview

Seven core techniques for generating innovative abstract strategy game concepts. Each technique approaches ideation from a different angle to break conventional thinking patterns.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Creative Methods
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## The Seven Techniques

### 1. Mechanism Extraction from Non-Games
Mining real-world systems for game mechanics
- **Location:** [[mechanism-extraction.md]]
- **Key Sources:** Physics, biology, economics, chemistry, architecture, music
- **Example Output:** Gravity wells, ecosystem balance, market dynamics

### 2. Extreme Property Isolation
Push one game property to its limit
- **Location:** [[extreme-property-isolation.md]]
- **Key Properties:** Visibility, symmetry, permanence, scale, connectivity
- **Example Output:** Invisible pieces, infinite boards, time-delayed moves

### 3. Impossible Constraint Challenges
Design within "impossible" limitations
- **Location:** [[impossible-constraints.md]]
- **Key Constraints:** Spatial, temporal, piece, interaction limits
- **Example Output:** 1D games, simultaneous play, single piece type

### 4. Anti-Pattern Starting Points
Design bad games, then invert
- **Location:** [[anti-pattern-inversion.md]]
- **Key Anti-Patterns:** No decisions, immediate end, infinite loops
- **Example Output:** Forced interesting choices, dynamic conclusions

### 5. Mathematical Structure Mining
Extract mechanics from mathematical concepts
- **Location:** [[mathematical-mining.md]]
- **Key Areas:** Graph theory, topology, number theory, combinatorics
- **Example Output:** Network games, modular arithmetic mechanics

### 6. Interaction Primitive Combinations
Combine basic interaction types in new ways
- **Location:** [[interaction-primitives.md]]
- **Key Primitives:** Move, place, remove, transform, connect, block
- **Example Output:** Move+transform, place+connect chains

### 7. Victory Condition Permutations
Explore unconventional winning conditions
- **Location:** [[victory-permutations.md]]
- **Key Types:** Emergent, collaborative, asymmetric, dynamic
- **Example Output:** Pattern completion, mutual goals, changing objectives

## Using the Techniques

### Sequential Application
1. **Start with any technique** that resonates
2. **Generate 5-10 concepts** per technique
3. **Don't judge** during generation
4. **Record everything** in template format
5. **Move to next technique** when flow stops

### Combination Strategies
- **Technique Chaining**: Output from one feeds another
- **Parallel Generation**: Multiple techniques on same theme
- **Constraint Stacking**: Apply multiple simultaneously
- **Inversion Mixing**: Combine with anti-patterns

### Time Allocation
- **Per Technique**: 15-20 minutes maximum
- **Total Session**: 2-3 hours for all seven
- **Break Pattern**: Rest between techniques
- **Documentation**: 2-3 minutes per concept

## Quality Indicators

### Strong Concepts Show
- Immediate "how would that work?" reaction
- Clear core mechanic
- Multiple strategic possibilities evident
- Simple to explain, hard to master
- Novel but not gimmicky

### Weak Concepts Show
- Complexity without purpose
- Derivative of existing games
- Single optimal strategy obvious
- Requires extensive explanation
- Novelty over gameplay
