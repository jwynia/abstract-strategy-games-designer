# Mechanism Extraction from Non-Games

## Overview

This technique involves identifying interesting mechanics and systems from real-world domains and abstracting them into game mechanics. It's particularly effective for creating thematically coherent mechanics that feel intuitive despite being abstract.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Creative Technique
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Source Domains

### Physics & Chemistry
**Phenomena to Extract:**
- **Gravity**: Pieces attract/repel based on mass or distance
- **Momentum**: Pieces continue moving until blocked
- **Phase Changes**: Pieces transform under conditions
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Circular movement patterns
- **Wave Interference**: Overlapping effects cancel/amplify
- **Magnetic Fields**: Directional influence zones
- **Chemical Bonds**: Limited connection points
- **Entropy**: Order naturally decreases

**Example Mechanic:**
"Gravity Wells" - Larger piece groups pull individual pieces toward them, creating natural clustering dynamics.

### Biology & Ecology
**Systems to Extract:**
- **Predator-Prey**: Cyclic dominance (A beats B beats C beats A)
- **Symbiosis**: Mutual benefit mechanics
- **Territoriality**: Area control with contested borders
- **Migration**: Seasonal movement patterns
- **Evolution**: Pieces adapt based on environment
- **Food Chains**: Hierarchical capture systems
- **Reproduction**: Piece generation mechanics
- **Swarm Behavior**: Collective movement rules

**Example Mechanic:**
"Ecosystem Balance" - Three piece types in cyclic dominance, with population limits creating dynamic equilibrium.

### Economics & Markets
**Concepts to Extract:**
- **Supply/Demand**: Value changes with scarcity
- **Investment**: Delayed returns on actions
- **Market Bubbles**: Cascading value collapse
- **Trade Routes**: Connection value mechanics
- **Inflation**: Decreasing action effectiveness
- **Monopoly**: Exclusive area control benefits
- **Arbitrage**: Exploiting position differences
- **Compound Interest**: Exponential growth patterns

**Example Mechanic:**
"Trade Networks" - Connections between pieces increase in value with network size, but become vulnerable to disruption.

### Architecture & Engineering
**Principles to Extract:**
- **Load Bearing**: Support requirements for structures
- **Tension/Compression**: Balanced forces
- **Modular Construction**: Standardized building blocks
- **Foundation Requirements**: Base stability needs
- **Structural Integrity**: Collapse mechanics
- **Bridge Building**: Spanning gaps efficiently
- **Cantilevers**: Extended unsupported reaches
- **Resonance**: Cumulative destabilization

**Example Mechanic:**
"Structural Support" - Pieces must form stable structures; unsupported pieces collapse in chain reactions.

### Music & Rhythm
**Elements to Extract:**
- **Harmony**: Piece combinations create effects
- **Rhythm**: Timed action sequences
- **Crescendo**: Building intensity mechanics
- **Call/Response**: Forced reaction patterns
- **Polyphony**: Multiple independent lines
- **Dissonance**: Incompatible positions
- **Tempo Changes**: Variable action speeds
- **Rests**: Strategic inaction

**Example Mechanic:**
"Harmonic Resonance" - Pieces in specific patterns amplify each other's effects or movement range.

### Social Dynamics
**Behaviors to Extract:**
- **Coalition Formation**: Temporary alliances
- **Information Cascades**: Spreading effects
- **Social Proof**: Following majority actions
- **Status Hierarchies**: Positional advantages
- **Network Effects**: Value from connections
- **Crowd Dynamics**: Movement affecting movement
- **Trust Building**: Repeated interaction benefits
- **Reputation**: Historical action consequences

**Example Mechanic:**
"Influence Propagation" - Control spreads through connections, but weakens with distance from source.

## Extraction Process

### Step 1: Identify Core Dynamic
- What makes this system interesting?
- What creates tension or decision points?
- What patterns emerge naturally?

### Step 2: Abstract to Essentials
- Remove theme-specific details
- Identify minimum components
- Find mathematical relationships

### Step 3: Gamify the Dynamic
- Add player agency
- Create win/loss conditions
- Balance positive/negative feedback

### Step 4: Test Simplifications
- Can it work with fewer rules?
- Are all elements necessary?
- Does complexity add depth?

## Successful Extractions

### Case Study: Magnetic Chess
**Source**: Magnetic field interactions
**Extraction**: Pieces have polarity; same poles repel, opposite attract
**Result**: Movement creates chain reactions, adding tactical depth

### Case Study: Tectonic
**Source**: Plate tectonics
**Extraction**: Board sections slowly shift, changing connections
**Result**: Long-term strategic planning with dynamic terrain

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Literal Translation
- **Wrong**: Trying to simulate physics accurately
- **Right**: Capturing the interesting decision dynamic

### Theme Over Mechanics
- **Wrong**: Forcing narrative elements
- **Right**: Using theme as inspiration only

### Complexity Creep
- **Wrong**: Adding details for "realism"
- **Right**: Simplifying to essential interactions
