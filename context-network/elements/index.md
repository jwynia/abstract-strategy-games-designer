# Elements - Abstract Strategy Game Design

## Overview

This section contains all the domain-specific elements for abstract strategy game design. It is organized into logical categories covering the complete game design lifecycle from ideation through implementation.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Core Concept
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Element Categories

### 1. Design Methodologies

## Navigation Paths

### For New Designers
1. Start with [[design-methodologies/index.md]] to understand the systematic approach
2. Explore [[creative-ideation/index.md]] for idea generation
3. Study [[game-mechanics/index.md]] to understand building blocks
4. Review [[game-concepts/index.md]] for examples

### For Game Development
1. Begin with [[creative-ideation/index.md]] if starting fresh
2. Use [[game-mechanics/index.md]] to select appropriate mechanisms
3. Follow [[evaluation-testing/index.md]] for validation
4. Consult [[implementation/index.md]] for platform-specific guidance

### For Documentation
1. Review [[notation-systems/index.md]] for recording games
2. Check [[game-concepts/index.md]] for documentation patterns
3. Use [[resources-tools/index.md]] for software support
