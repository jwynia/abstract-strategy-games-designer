# Game Concepts Repository

## Overview

This repository contains original abstract strategy game designs created using the frameworks and methodologies in this project. Each game represents a complete design from concept through implementation specifications.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Design Output
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Organization Structure

### Game Categories

#### By Development Stage
- **Concepts**: Early ideas and rough sketches
- **Prototypes**: Games with basic rules being tested
- **Refined**: Fully developed rule sets
- **Implemented**: Games with digital/physical versions

#### By Core Mechanic
- **Territory**: Area control and influence games
- **Connection**: Path and network building games
- **Capture**: Piece elimination games
- **Pattern**: Formation and arrangement games
- **Movement**: Position and mobility games

#### By Complexity Level
- **Minimal** (< 5 rules): Ultra-simple games
- **Light** (5-10 rules): Easy to learn
- **Medium** (10-20 rules): Moderate complexity
- **Heavy** (20+ rules): Complex strategies

## Game Documentation Template

Each game should have:
1. **Overview** - One paragraph description
2. **Core Mechanic** - Primary gameplay driver  
3. **Rules** - Complete, unambiguous ruleset
4. **Setup** - Initial game state
5. **Victory Conditions** - How to win
6. **Strategy Notes** - Basic strategic concepts
7. **Notation** - How to record games
8. **Implementation** - Physical/digital considerations
9. **Testing Log** - Playtesting results
10. **Design Notes** - Creator's commentary

## Submission Process

### For New Games
1. Create initial concept document
2. Assign to appropriate category
3. Begin playtesting log
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Move through stages as refined

### Documentation Requirements
- Use provided template
- Include visual diagrams
- Provide example games
- Record all rule changes
- Note design decisions

## Evaluation Criteria

### Quality Metrics
- **Depth-to-Complexity Ratio**: >10:1 preferred
- **Decision Density**: Meaningful choices each turn
- **Game Length**: Natural conclusion within time
- **Balance**: No dominant strategies
- **Originality**: Novel mechanics or combinations

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 10 playtests
- Different skill levels
- Record common patterns
- Note confusion points
- Track game lengths

## Navigation

### By Interest
- **Latest Additions**: Check recent updates
- **Most Tested**: See refined games
- **Simplest Games**: Start with minimal
- **Most Innovative**: Explore unique mechanics

### By Purpose
- **Teaching Games**: Good for newcomers
- **Tournament Games**: Balanced for competition
- **Quick Games**: Under 15 minutes
- **Deep Games**: High strategic ceiling

## Contributing

### Design Challenges
Current challenges for new designs:
1. Create a territory game without a grid
2. Design capture without removal
3. Make a 3-player abstract strategy
4. Create depth with only 3 rules
5. Design a game on unusual topology

### Collaboration
- Open to community submissions
- Peer review available
- Playtesting network access
- Design workshop sessions
