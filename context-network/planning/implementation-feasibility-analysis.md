**Time**: Rewind Chess (#020) - move history tracking
**Multi-Dimensional**: Fold Space (#022) - topology calculations
**Physics**: Gravity Wells (#024) - multi-body physics

### Hybrid-Optimal (9 games - 22.5%)
Games that can be played physically but significantly benefit from digital assistance.

**Connection**: Neural Network (#004) - pathway strength tracking
**Movement**: Teleportation Tactics (#010) - trace management
**Information**: Memory Maze (#016) - temporary reveals
**Time**: Temporal Tactics (#019) - timeline tracking
**Rule**: Law Makers (#027) - evolving rule sets
**Pattern**: Pattern Prophet (#040) - pattern history

## Key Patterns

### Physical-Friendly Characteristics
- Visual state verification (symmetry, patterns)
- Simple component tracking (tokens, markers)
- Turn-based resource management
- Clear spatial relationships
- Binary states (captured/free, connected/not)

### Digital-Required Characteristics
- Hidden information management
- Complex calculations (probability, physics)
- Extensive state history tracking
- Dynamic topology changes
- Real-time or simultaneous resolution

### Hybrid Benefits
- Complex but trackable states
- Pattern or history analysis
- Rule complexity management
- Enhanced user experience
- Reduced bookkeeping burden

## Recommendations

### For Initial Prototyping
Focus on Physical-Friendly games for rapid iteration:
1. Conversion Cascade (#006) - simple mechanics, high interaction
2. Constellation Constructor (#007) - visual appeal, easy to understand
3. Bridge Builder's Dilemma (#003) - clear strategy, manageable complexity

### For Digital Development
Prioritize unique mechanics only possible digitally:
1. Quantum Territory (#001) - probability mechanics
2. Shadow Warfare (#015) - information asymmetry
3. Fold Space (#022) - dynamic topology

### For Hybrid Development
Start physical, add digital enhancements:
1. Neural Network (#004) - core game physical, tracking digital
2. Pattern Prophet (#040) - pattern analysis assistance
3. Memory Maze (#016) - timer and reveal management

## Platform Decision Framework

When evaluating new ideas, consider:

1. **Information Visibility**: Can all game state be open?
2. **Calculation Complexity**: Are computations human-friendly?
3. **Component Count**: Under 100 distinct trackable elements?
4. **State Changes**: Are changes discrete and permanent?
5. **Timing Requirements**: Turn-based vs real-time needs?

If any answer is "No", consider digital or hybrid implementation.

## External Platform Compatibility

### AbstractPlay Research (2025-06-23)
See: [[../elements/implementation/abstractplay-architecture-discovery.md]]

Key findings for implementation compatibility:
- Well-defined game interface (TypeScript base class)
- Clear state management pattern (stack-based history)
- Modular rendering system (separate renderer module)
- Simple REST API structure (two main endpoints)

Compatibility considerations:
- Games must implement specific interface methods
- State serialization format must be compatible
- Rendering data format has specific requirements
- Currently requires all games in monolithic library

Alternative implementation opportunities:
- Could implement compatible game interface
- Rendering pattern is reusable
- API structure simple to replicate
- State management pattern is portable
