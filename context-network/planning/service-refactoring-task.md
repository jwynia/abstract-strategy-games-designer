# Service Refactoring Task - Route Analysis

## Task: Identify Routes Needing Service Interfaces

### Start Time: 2025-06-24
### Update: 2025-06-24 - Major Progress

## Current Status

### ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS
1. **ServiceContainer** - Dependency injection system implemented
2. **Service middleware** - Auto-injection into Hono context
3. **Mock services implemented:**
   - MockUserService
   - MockChallengeService
   - MockFederationService
   - MockGameService
   - MockTournamentService
   - MockExplorationService
4. **Routes refactored to use services:**
   - games.ts
   - game-instances.ts
   - challenges.ts
   - federation.ts
   - players.ts
   - tournaments.ts
   - explorations.ts

### Original Route Analysis (Before Refactoring)
1. **games.ts** - ✅ REFACTORED (now uses IGameService)
2. **game-instances.ts** - ✅ REFACTORED (now uses IGameService)
3. **tournaments.ts** - ✅ REFACTORED (now uses ITournamentService)
4. **explorations.ts** - ✅ REFACTORED (now uses IExplorationService)
5. **push-notifications.ts** - ❌ Still uses in-memory Map storage
6. **events.ts** - ❌ Still uses in-memory Map storage
7. **bot.ts** - ❌ Still uses inline mock functions

### Service Interface Status
- IUserService ✅ (interface + MockUserService)
- IChallengeService ✅ (interface + MockChallengeService)
- IFederationService ✅ (interface + MockFederationService)
- IGameService ✅ (interface + MockGameService)
- ITournamentService ✅ (interface + MockTournamentService)
- IExplorationService ✅ (interface + MockExplorationService)

## Remaining Services Needed

### 1. ✅ MockGameService - COMPLETED
**Status**: Implemented
**Routes**: games.ts, game-instances.ts
**Implementation includes**:
- Game catalog management
- Game instance lifecycle
- Move validation and execution
- Game state management
- SVG rendering

### 2. ✅ MockTournamentService - COMPLETED
**Status**: Implemented
**Route**: tournaments.ts
**Implementation includes**:
- Tournament creation and management
- Player registration
- Match scheduling
- Standings calculation

### 3. ✅ IExplorationService + MockExplorationService - COMPLETED
**Status**: Implemented
**Route**: explorations.ts
**Implementation includes**:
- Save/load explorations
- Playground state management
- Game notes management
- Comments system

### 4. IPushNotificationService + MockPushNotificationService
**Status**: Not created
**Route**: push-notifications.ts
**Responsibilities**:
- Subscription management
- Notification sending
- Settings management

### 5. IEventService + MockEventService
**Status**: Not created
**Route**: events.ts
**Responsibilities**:
- Event creation and publishing
- Player registration
- Game creation and results
- Event lifecycle

### 6. IBotService + MockBotService
**Status**: Not created
**Route**: bot.ts
**Responsibilities**:
- Move calculation
- Position analysis
- Bot game creation
- Statistics tracking

## Implementation Priority

1. **MockGameService** - Core functionality, interface already exists
2. **MockTournamentService** - Core functionality, interface already exists
3. **IExplorationService + Mock** - Important for player experience
4. **IEventService + Mock** - Organized play features
5. **IBotService + Mock** - AI opponent features
6. **IPushNotificationService + Mock** - Supporting feature

## Next Steps

1. Implement MockGameService using existing IGameService interface
2. Implement MockTournamentService using existing ITournamentService interface
3. Create remaining service interfaces
4. Implement mock services for remaining interfaces
5. Update routes to use services via ServiceContainer
6. Remove inline mock data and in-memory storage from routes

## Implementation Pattern

Each service should follow the pattern established by existing services:
- Interface in `services/interfaces/IServiceName.ts`
- Mock implementation in `services/mock/MockServiceName.ts`
- Registration in ServiceContainer
- Type exports in `services/index.ts`
