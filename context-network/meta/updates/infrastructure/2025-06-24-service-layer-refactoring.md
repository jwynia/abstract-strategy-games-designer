## Classification
- **Domain:** Infrastructure
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Summary
Successfully completed comprehensive service layer refactoring to implement dependency injection pattern across the Abstract Strategy Games API server, replacing inline mock data and in-memory storage with a proper service architecture.

## Refactoring Achievements

### Service Architecture Implementation

#### Core Components Created
1. **ServiceContainer** (`services/ServiceContainer.ts`)
   - Singleton pattern implementation
   - Type-safe service registration and retrieval
   - Support for all required services
   - Reset capability for testing

2. **Service Initialization** (`services/index.ts`)
   - Centralized service registration
   - Mock/real implementation switching
   - All services initialized at startup

3. **Middleware Integration** (`middleware/services.ts`)
   - Services injected into Hono context
   - Type-safe access via `c.get('services')`
   - Available to all routes automatically

### Service Interfaces Created

1. **IUserService** - User management operations
2. **IChallengeService** - Challenge system operations
3. **IFederationService** - Federation communication
4. **IGameService** - Game catalog and instance management
5. **ITournamentService** - Tournament management
6. **IExplorationService** - Game exploration features

### Mock Implementations Completed

1. **MockUserService**
   - User CRUD operations
   - User search functionality
   - User statistics

2. **MockChallengeService**
   - Challenge lifecycle management
   - Challenge state transitions
   - Challenge queries

3. **MockFederationService**
   - Federation messaging
   - Remote server communication
   - Message queuing

4. **MockGameService**
   - Game catalog management
   - Game instance creation and updates
   - Move validation and execution
   - Game state management
   - SVG rendering

5. **MockTournamentService**
   - Tournament creation and management
   - Player registration
   - Match scheduling
   - Standings calculation

6. **MockExplorationService**
   - Exploration save/load
   - Playground state management
   - Notes and comments system

### Route Refactoring

All routes have been updated to use services via dependency injection:

1. **games.ts** - Uses IGameService
2. **game-instances.ts** - Uses IGameService
3. **tournaments.ts** - Uses ITournamentService
4. **explorations.ts** - Uses IExplorationService
5. **challenges.ts** - Uses IChallengeService
6. **federation.ts** - Uses IFederationService
7. **players.ts** - Uses IUserService

### Architectural Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Business logic moved to service layer
   - Routes focused on HTTP handling
   - Clear service boundaries

2. **Testability**
   - Mock services enable unit testing
   - Service container reset for test isolation
   - Interface-based programming

3. **Maintainability**
   - Centralized service management
   - Easy to swap implementations
   - Consistent patterns across codebase

4. **Type Safety**
   - Full TypeScript types throughout
   - Interface contracts enforced
   - Context type augmentation for Hono

## Implementation Details

### Service Registration Pattern
```typescript
// In services/index.ts
container.register('game', new MockGameService())
container.register('tournament', new MockTournamentService())
// etc.
```

### Route Usage Pattern
```typescript
// In routes
const services = c.get('services')
const game = await services.game.getGame(gameId)
```

### Dependency Injection Flow
1. App initialization calls `initializeServices()`
2. Services registered in ServiceContainer
3. Middleware injects services into context
4. Routes access services via context

## Outstanding Items

### Services Not Yet Implemented
1. **IEventService** - Event management
2. **IBotService** - AI opponent features
3. **IPushNotificationService** - Push notifications

### Routes Not Yet Refactored
1. **events.ts** - Still uses in-memory storage
2. **bot.ts** - Still uses inline mock functions
3. **push-notifications.ts** - Still uses in-memory storage

## Next Steps

1. Create remaining service interfaces
2. Implement mock services for remaining interfaces
3. Update remaining routes to use services
4. Add comprehensive service tests
5. Document service APIs
