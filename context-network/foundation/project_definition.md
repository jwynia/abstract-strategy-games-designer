### Project Overview

The Abstract Strategy Games Designer project is a comprehensive framework and toolkit for creating innovative abstract strategy games for both tabletop and digital implementations. It combines systematic design methodologies, creative ideation techniques, and practical implementation tools to enable the development of games with deep strategic gameplay while maintaining elegant simplicity.

### Vision Statement

To establish a premier resource for abstract strategy game designers that democratizes the creation of deeply engaging games, fostering innovation in the genre while honoring its timeless principles of perfect information, zero luck, and emergent complexity.

### Mission Statement

We provide game designers with comprehensive frameworks, methodologies, and tools to conceptualize, design, test, and implement abstract strategy games that offer meaningful strategic depth, accessible rules, and engaging gameplay experiences across both physical and digital mediums.

### Project Objectives

1. **Design Framework Development**: Create and maintain comprehensive methodologies for designing abstract strategy games from concept to implementation
2. **Innovation in Game Mechanics**: Develop novel game mechanics and systems that expand the boundaries of abstract strategy gaming
3. **Dual-Platform Implementation**: Ensure all game designs consider both tabletop and digital implementations from inception
4. **Community Resource**: Build a repository of reusable patterns, notation systems, and design knowledge for the abstract strategy game community
5. **Quality Game Portfolio**: Design and develop a portfolio of original abstract strategy games demonstrating the framework's effectiveness

### Success Criteria

1. **Framework Completeness**: All major aspects of abstract strategy game design are covered with actionable methodologies
2. **Game Quality**: Designed games demonstrate strategic depth with depth-to-complexity ratios exceeding 10:1
3. **Implementation Viability**: Each game design includes clear paths for both physical and digital implementation
4. **Community Adoption**: Resources and tools are utilized by external game designers
5. **Portfolio Diversity**: At least 5 distinct abstract strategy games demonstrating different core mechanisms

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Comprehensive design frameworks for abstract strategy games
- Creative ideation methodologies specific to the genre
- Notation system development guidelines
- Evaluation and playtesting protocols
- Implementation considerations for physical and digital versions
- Original game designs as framework demonstrations
- Resource curation and tool recommendations
- Mathematical foundations and analysis methods
- Balance and fairness evaluation techniques

#### Out of Scope

- Games with hidden information or chance elements
- Real-time strategy games
- Commercial game publishing or marketing
- Detailed programming implementations (beyond specifications)
- Art direction or visual design guidelines
- Monetization strategies
- Games requiring specialized equipment beyond standard boards/pieces

### Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibilities | Representative(s) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Project Owner | Overall vision, direction, and quality | [Owner] |
| Game Designer | Create game concepts and mechanics | [Designer] |
| Framework Developer | Build and refine design methodologies | [Developer] |
| Playtester | Evaluate games and provide feedback | Community |
| Implementation Developer | Create digital/physical prototypes | [Developer] |

### Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Framework Foundation | Month 1 | Core design methodologies established |
| First Game Prototype | Month 2 | Initial game design with full documentation |
| Notation System | Month 3 | Complete notation framework for recording games |
| Digital Tools Integration | Month 4 | Integration with Ludii or similar platforms |
| Portfolio Completion | Month 6 | 5+ complete game designs with implementations |

### Budget and Resources

- Primary resource investment is time and expertise
- Open-source tools prioritized (Ludii, Zillions of Games)
- Community resources for playtesting and feedback
- Minimal budget for physical prototype materials

### Constraints

- Games must adhere to abstract strategy principles (perfect information, no chance)
- Designs should be implementable with standard components when possible
- Digital implementations should work on common platforms
- Notation systems must be human-readable and computer-parseable

### Assumptions

- Target audience has basic familiarity with strategy games
- Access to playtesting communities through online forums
- Standard game components (boards, pieces) are available
- Digital implementation tools remain accessible

### Risks

- Over-complexity in game designs reducing accessibility
- Insufficient playtesting leading to unbalanced games
- Framework becoming too theoretical without practical application
- Difficulty in achieving true innovation within genre constraints
